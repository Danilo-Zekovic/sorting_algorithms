Sorting algorithms in testBed.js
timing.js is for measuring time of sorting 
and all other files are for testing different ways of sorting data


using d8
to run the code run one of the test files by typing d8 'name of the file'

commands to run the testing files:

d8 bs.js                bubble sort
d8 is.js                insertion sort
d8 ms.js                merge sort
d8 shellsortTest.js     shell sort
d8 shellsort2Test.js    shell2 sort
d8 ss.js                selection sort
d8 tb.js                just to test testBed and generation random numbers
d8 timing.js               calculates the time needed to execute
